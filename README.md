# opencv_using_CNN
This project involves the RANE car braking pad and utilizes a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) algorithm. While the dataset cannot be shared, the code provided demonstrates how the CNN algorithm works. You are encouraged to experiment with the program by using various datasets and modifying the code as needed to deepen your understanding of CNN algorithms.
